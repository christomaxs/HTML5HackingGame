HTML5HackingGame
================

A new hacking game to be built in HTML5 and javascript, With the lack of a good and recently updated hacking game, I feel that this is a goo idea for a project, because after hours of searching, I was not able to  find a single good hacking simulator that has been constantly updated. Our goal is to get a working game, that at this point will most likely be single player, but in the future possibly networking abilities.
